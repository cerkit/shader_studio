Please generate a shader that moves the camera through a tunnel using 3D fractal shapes. The fractals should be varying shades of purple and red. The shader should last 20 seconds and be a seamless looping video when rendered. Make the camera "wobble" so that it moves along the X and Y axis. The camera should start and end at the same location and the fractal color should match what it was at the beginning.
